# systems-programming
Made for an operating systems course exercise.
This code basically shows how multithreading works in a Unix environment.
When called using arguments such as: "./schedule 5 8 2 7", 4 threads are created -which are counting down from the corresponding numbers.
If ./schedule is called without any argument, threads are created with random numbers.
Both cases (with and without arguments) are shown in the given screenshots.
