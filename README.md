This code basically shows how multithreading works in a Unix environment.
When called using arguments such as: "./schedule 5 5 5 5", 4 threads are created -each thread counting down from 5.
If ./schedule is called without any argument, random sized threads are created.
Both cases (with and without arguments) are shown in the given screenshots.
